program will start with a hardcoded starting date I will get that manually (4th of jan)

will have a variable that counts how many pills should have been taken (counting the day of)

program will go from the day of all the way down till the starting date.

start off by adding 2 and then 1 and just go back and forth. Since if i go by date(ex: 1st = 1 pill, 4th  2 pills). I will run into
problems when a month has 31 days .
