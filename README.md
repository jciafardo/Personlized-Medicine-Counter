I created this Python script calculates how many Accutane pills should be left in my box so I did not miss days.

## Features

- Calculates remaining pills based on start date, daily dosage, and total prescribed pills.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the script.

## Example

Suppose you started Accutane on January 1, 2024, with a daily dosage of 2 pills and a total prescription of 60 pills. If today is June 17, 2024, running the script will indicate how many pills should be left.
